- Create and Edit posts with form validation
- Protected routes (client-side)
- RESTful API with Express & MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Clean and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, React Router DOM, Tailwind CSS, Axios, Yarn  
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose)  
- No JWT token authentication (simple session/localStorage-based)

---

# Usage
Navigate to http://localhost:5173/admin-login to access the login page.

After login, you will be redirected to the dashboard.

Use the sidebar to navigate between Dashboard, Create Post, and Logout.

On the dashboard, you can edit or delete posts.

When editing, the form is pre-filled with post data. After successful edit, youâ€™ll be redirected back to the dashboard with a success message.

# Notes / Assumptions
Authentication is simple and does NOT use JWT or any token-based system.

MongoDB connection string is not included in the repo for security reasons.

To test with your own database, update .env with your connection URI.

The UI is built with Tailwind CSS, so ensure your dev environment supports PostCSS and Tailwind.

Error handling is basic for demonstration purposes.
